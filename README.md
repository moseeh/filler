# FILLER

Filler is an algorithmic strategy game where two AI-controlled robots battle to dominate a shared grid — known as the Anfield — by placing randomly generated pieces. The challenge is to build the largest possible territory while obeying strict placement rules and outmaneuvering your opponent.
